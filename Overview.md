# Introduction #

Swarm Sandbox provides an open platform to explore emergent bahaviour in swarms without specialist equipment or knowledge.


# Details #

Swarm Sandbox is an application for mobile phones that is designed to explore emergent behaviour in swarms. It achieves this by allowing any phone with the application installed to become aware of neighboring devices, and create a flexible and fluid network. When phones are connected or “swarmed” together the user is able to create rules which trigger a given action either locally or globally, for example flashing and beeping. These rules are triggered either by changes in the swarm, a global swarm “heartbeat” or changes in the environment.
