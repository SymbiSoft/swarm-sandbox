The following desirable features will eventually be implemented in this project:

**Quicker Bluetooth detection - Currently due to technical constraints the bluetooth discovery takes between 10-20 seconds.**

**No Bluetooth collisions - Devices currently do not discover each other if they are both simultaneously in discovery mode.**

**Plugin architecture - Allow new modules/rules/actions to be easily added to the application by just dropping the class file in the designated folder. Also allows others to develop for the project easier.**

**More plugins / modules - Only modules currently included are CAMERA FLASH and VIBRATION. Would like to see this application extended so that the rules can be modified via text message (somebody texts the phone with a new ruleset). Also a desirable feature would be able to send the ruleset to other phones.**

> - Module idea - SWARM ENCRYPTION - a designated selection of phones must be swarmed together to encrypt/decrypt a piece of data/file.

**Functional and pleasing GUI - Currently only text based**

**Widget for S60 - This app could easily run in the background, and display all relevant information/controls via a Standby screen widget.**
